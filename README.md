# Seasonal Discounts

A student project for Nashville Software School written by Jim Stokley, Mohamad Sharif, and Allen Phelps

Our code uses the following javascript libraries to visualize a ficational store's inventory provided in JSON file format.

+jQuery
+Requirejs
+Require Handlebars plugin
+Bootstrap

Users can also compare base and seasonal sale prices using a season selector.

## Setup

Our code is dependent on the libraries listed above. If you want to run our code locally, please be sure to run npm and bower installs in the 'lib' directory after downloading.

Also, you'll need to host your own http-server from the root directory of the project (where index.html is).

Enjoy
